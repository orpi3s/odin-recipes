First iteration of the site is based off of the Odin project's foundations course. Version 0.0.1 serves as the base template for the project of making a dedicated webpage for Jett mains that play Valorant. Future releases will include information on ways to enter site as Jett, best maps, team comps, team strategies, and several other things. Keep in mind as things go forward the site will make a fairly obvious change from a "cooking recipes" webpage to a "All things Jett" webpage.
